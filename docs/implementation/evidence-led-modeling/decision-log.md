# Evidence-led modeling — decision log (to merge into `toolkit-design-decisions.md`)

These entries follow the standard `DD-NNN` template but live here while the
evidence-led / accelerator-first work is on a feature track. DD numbers are
**placeholders** (`DD-EL-N`); assign final sequential `DD-NNN` numbers and move
these into `docs/design/toolkit-design-decisions.md` (and its Index) at merge.

## DD-EL-1: Claim Registry replaces alignment YAML as the governance source of truth

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Affects:** `model/claims/{domain}-claims.yaml` (new), `{domain}-alignment.yaml`
(retired), `propose_alignment.py`, `alignment_coverage.py`, silver/dbt projectors,
`check-alignment` / `check-source-coverage`, evidence-led design skills
**Implementation:** Slice 0B schema → Slice 1 migration → Slice 2 projector
authority. Spec: `docs/implementation/evidence-led-modeling/0b-claim-registry-schema-v1.md`

### Context

The evidence-led accelerator-first methodology needs a single governed artifact
that records *which concepts are approved to materialize*, with evidence,
ownership, dispositions, and silver-contract impact. The existing
`{domain}-alignment.yaml` carries the proposal data but is an AI-output artifact,
not a governance record, and there is no approval lifecycle. Maintaining both an
alignment file and a registry would create a dual source-of-truth.

### Decision

Introduce a per-domain **Claim Registry** at `model/claims/{domain}-claims.yaml`
(schema v1) as the single hand-governed source of truth. **Retire**
`{domain}-alignment.yaml` via a one-way deterministic migration; once a domain has
a claims file, the legacy alignment file is rejected with a migration message (no
dual path). The registry covers every guarantee the alignment path provided
(per-(system,table,column) coverage snapshot, freshness hashes, algorithm/prompt
version, anchor state, custom-column triage, table/column-granular evidence) — the
parity appendix in `00-index.md` gates Slice 1.

### Rationale

One governed file with an explicit `status` lifecycle (proposed → approved → …)
and `disposition` vocabulary (claim / specialize / passthrough / skip / gap) gives
reviewable, GitHub-PR-based governance. Reusing the alignment backend functions
(coverage, freshness, anchor state) preserves all existing guarantees while
avoiding double-path logic. Golden + parity + negative migration tests enforce
fidelity.

### Consequences

- Slice 1 cannot merge until parity tests prove the registry preserves every
  alignment guarantee.
- `propose-alignment` output becomes migration input, not a parallel artifact.
- Custom-column triage values map: `model`→`specialize`/`claim`,
  `silver-passthrough`→`passthrough`, `skip`→`skip`.
- Claim ids are stable and never reused; deletions become `deprecated`.

### Slice 1 implementation note (2026-06-15)

The cutover unified the two retired gates into a single **`check-claims`** command
(backend `claim_coverage.py`): bucket priority `missing > invalid > incomplete >
stale > unverifiable > ok`, blocking on missing/invalid/incomplete/stale/
duplicate-approved + (unless `--no-source-coverage`) unmapped tables, with
`--strict` additionally blocking on undecided (`proposed`) claims and `--warn-only`
overriding to exit 0. Leftover `*-alignment.yaml` files are a hard error regardless
of `--warn-only`. `alignment_coverage.py` was purged of all alignment-YAML reader
machinery and now exposes only the reused affinity/freshness primitives and triage
heuristics (still imported by `claim_coverage`, `source_coverage`, and
`propose_alignment`). The module keeps its name despite the narrowed role.

## DD-EL-2: A1 — generate `owl:imports` from approved claims (defer import-all / C2)

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Affects:** domain `owl:imports`, generated `silverInclude` / `silverIncludeImports`,
silver/dbt projectors, catalog wiring
**Implementation:** Slice 2 (import generation). Evidence:
`docs/implementation/evidence-led-modeling/slice-0a-closure-spike.md`

### Context

The accelerator-first concept (C2) proposed importing the **full** accelerator
pack into every hub and policing the large unclaimed surface with a no-bypass
projector. The Slice 0A spike measured this against acme-hub.

### Decision

Adopt **A1**: each domain's `owl:imports` (and accelerator sub-pack selection) is
**generated from approved class claims** plus their required closure. The full
import-all-then-suppress design (C2) is **deferred**, to be reconsidered only if a
dedicated real large-closure spike (catalog-resolved, fibo/CLdN-scale, many shared
ranges) clears both projection wall-time and FK-leak.

### Rationale

Slice 0A confirmed claim-driven suppression of unclaimed **imported** classes
leaks no FKs (`refp:Address`, `refp:ShipOperator` clean — correctness PASS), but
acme-hub structurally cannot follow `owl:imports` without a catalog (logistics
parsed to 26 triples) and is too small for a perf signal — so C2's *motivating*
risk (full-closure load + leak at scale) is **unmeasured and unresolved**. A1
removes the risk by construction: importing only claimed closures means there is
no large unclaimed surface to police, no perf cliff, and no
"access-control-over-`owl:imports`" smell.

### Consequences

- Slice 2 simplifies to *generate imports*, not *suppress* them.
- The DD-021 no-bypass mechanism is retained in code but dormant.
- A future large-closure spike is the only gate that can revive C2.

## DD-EL-3: A2-lite + local-class governance (registry single source, surfaces generated & reviewable)

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Affects:** thin client ontology TTL, silver/gold extension TTL, `model/claims/`,
projector generation
**Implementation:** Slices 2–4. Spec:
`docs/implementation/evidence-led-modeling/0b-claim-registry-schema-v1.md` §1

### Context

Two coupled questions: (A2) should the Claim Registry be the *only* hand-authored
artifact, generating both extension annotations and thin-ontology stubs? And
(Slice 0A Finding 3) are **local** thin-ontology classes claim-gated, given DD-021
only governs *imported* classes (acme-hub materialized local `VesselCarrier` /
`ActiveMarker` regardless of claims)?

### Decision

- **A2-lite:** the Claim Registry is the single **governance** source of truth, and
  derived surfaces (domain `owl:imports`, `silverInclude` claims, thin-ontology
  `specialize` stubs) are **generated** from approved claims — but the thin
  ontology and silver/gold extension TTL files remain **first-class, reviewable PR
  artifacts**, not hidden intermediates. Full collapse is rejected for v1.
- **Finding 3 — implicit-claim-with-record:** a class authored in the thin client
  (domain-namespace) ontology is **implicitly approved** (authoring = claiming),
  but the registry still carries an auto-generated `origin: authored`,
  `status: approved` claim for it. Only **imported** (accelerator/reference-model)
  classes require an *explicit* claim to materialize.

### Rationale

Keeping reviewable TTL preserves the ontology diff reviewers rely on and avoids
over-coupling the registry schema to projector internals, while still giving a
single governance source and GitHub-PR-based change control. Implicit-claim-with-
record closes the governance gap surfaced in 0A: every materialized table — local
or imported — has exactly one registry row, so coverage/parity stay complete.

### Consequences

- Generators must (re)produce extension + thin-ontology files from claims and keep
  them in sync; a deterministic check flags hand-edits that materialize a class
  with no approved claim (Slice 2).
- The registry must auto-emit `origin: authored` claims for local classes so
  parity tooling sees them.
- Reviewers see both the registry change and the generated TTL diff in the PR.

## DD-EL-4: Slice 2 — claims deterministically drive `owl:imports` + `silverInclude`; silver/dbt/powerbi projection gated on claim/projection sync

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Affects:** domain `owl:imports`, `{domain}-silver-ext.ttl` (`kairos-ext:silverInclude`),
`model/claims/{domain}-claims.yaml`, `claim_projection_sync.py` (new),
`claims-to-silver-ext` CLI command (new), `check-claims` sync gate, `projector.py`
authority gate (silver/dbt/powerbi), foundation/thin-ontology scaffold
**Implementation:** Slice 2 (projection vertical slice). Realizes DD-EL-2 (A1) and
DD-EL-3 (A2-lite). Spec: `docs/implementation/evidence-led-modeling/slice-2-projection.md`

### Context

DD-EL-2 adopted **A1** (claims drive imports) and DD-EL-3 adopted **A2-lite**
(registry is the single governance source; derived TTL surfaces stay reviewable),
but until Slice 2 no code closed the loop from approved claims to materialized
output. The registry governed *what is approved* while the projection surfaces
(domain `owl:imports`, `silverInclude`) were still hand-authored, so nothing
guaranteed the two stayed in sync. DD-021's no-bypass mechanism existed in code but
was dormant (DD-EL-2), and import-all/no-bypass suppression (C2) was deferred.

### Decision

Make projection surfaces a deterministic function of approved imported class
claims, and gate materialization on their being in sync:

- A new `claim_projection_sync` module deterministically derives, from **approved
  imported** class claims, (1) the domain ontology's external `owl:imports` set and
  (2) per-class `kairos-ext:silverInclude` assertions in `{domain}-silver-ext.ttl`.
  It can evaluate drift (`evaluate_projection_sync`) or rewrite the surfaces
  (`apply_projection_sync`).
- A new **`claims-to-silver-ext`** CLI command generates/regenerates the imports +
  `silverInclude` surfaces from approved claims; `--check-only` reports drift and
  exits 1 without writing.
- **`check-claims`** gains a claim↔projection **sync gate** (with `--no-extension-sync`
  to skip) that blocks when imports / `silverInclude` drift from approved claims, or
  when a `silverIncludeImports` bulk-bypass flag is present.
- The **projector** enforces an **authority gate**: for silver/dbt/powerbi targets,
  if `model/claims/{domain}-claims.yaml` exists, projection of that domain FAILS
  (records a projection error) when the claim-derived imports/includes are out of
  sync — keeping DD-021's no-bypass guarantee but making materialization
  claim-driven.
- The starter domain-ontology scaffold imports a thin `_foundation` ontology
  (`foundation.ttl.template`), per A2-lite's thin-ontology scaffold.

### Rationale

Deriving `owl:imports` and `silverInclude` from approved claims realizes A1 by
construction — only claimed closures are imported, so there is no large unclaimed
surface to police and no import-all/no-bypass suppression. Retaining DD-021 as a
claim-driven authority gate (rather than retiring it) preserves the "no class
materializes without an approved claim" guarantee while keeping the registry the
single governance source. Keeping the surfaces as reviewable TTL (regenerated by
`claims-to-silver-ext`, validated by `check-claims --no-extension-sync` off by
default) honours DD-EL-3's A2-lite reviewability requirement.

### Consequences

- Hand-edits that drift imports / `silverInclude` away from approved claims are
  caught by `check-claims` and block silver/dbt/powerbi projection.
- `claims-to-silver-ext` is the canonical regeneration path after approving claims;
  `--check-only` makes drift a CI signal.
- DD-021 is no longer dormant — it is the claim-authority gate for materialization.
- New hubs scaffold a thin per-domain ontology importing `_foundation`.

### Slice 2 implementation note (2026-06-15)

Slice 2 landed the claim→projection loop: the deterministic
`claim_projection_sync` module (derive imports + `silverInclude` from approved
imported claims; evaluate or apply), the new `claims-to-silver-ext` CLI command
(regenerate surfaces; `--check-only` reports drift and exits 1), the `check-claims`
claim↔projection sync gate (`--no-extension-sync` to skip; blocks on drift or a
`silverIncludeImports` bulk bypass), and the projector authority gate that fails
silver/dbt/powerbi projection of a claims-governed domain when imports/includes are
out of sync. Scaffold gained `foundation.ttl.template` and the starter domain
ontology now `owl:imports` the thin `_foundation` ontology (A2-lite). This realizes
A1 (claims drive imports) while retaining DD-021 as a claim-driven gate.

## DD-EL-5: Slice 3 — derive-claims deterministic multi-source evidence aggregation

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Affects:** `model/claims/{domain}-claims.yaml`, new `derive_claims.py`,
`derive-claims` CLI command (new), `claim_registry.merge_preserving_decisions`,
`_concurrency.py` / `_cache.py`, evidence-led design skills
(`kairos-design-source`, `kairos-execute-project`)
**Implementation:** Slice 3 (richer evidence aggregation). Pure enhancement on top
of the Slice 1/2 path. Spec:
`docs/implementation/evidence-led-modeling/slice-3-derive-claims.md`

### Context

After Slice 1 the Claim Registry is the governance source of truth and after
Slice 2 approved claims deterministically drive projection. But authoring
candidate claims is still largely a hand exercise: the evidence needed to propose
them is scattered across several already-produced artifacts (`analyse-sources`
affinity reports, `propose-alignment` column→property output, `import-tmdl`
concept-mapping dispositions, SKOS mapping TTL, and sample-derived signals). The
semantically-hard LLM work that interprets sources already happened **upstream**
in `analyse-sources` (affinity) and `propose-alignment` (column→property), and
`propose-alignment` already writes `{domain}-claims.yaml`. What is missing is a
single step that joins those evidence streams into a richer candidate claim set so
a human curates rather than hand-authors.

### Decision

Add a new **`derive-claims`** CLI command: a **deterministic, AI-free** aggregator
that merges/enriches the existing Claim Registry with additional deterministic
evidence streams and attaches **multiple `evidence_sources` per claim**. It is a
pure enhancement on top of the working Slice 1/2 path and never blocks it.

`derive-claims` joins five evidence streams deterministically on
`(system, table[, column])` and ref_class/ref_property names:

1. **Existing claims registry** (base, from `propose-alignment`/`migrate`) —
   preserves prior candidates and any human curation.
2. **`analyse-sources` affinity** (`integration/sources/_analysis/*-affinity.yaml`)
   — table→domain routing; corroborates class claims and creates new `proposed`
   class candidates for affinity tables that have no alignment anchor yet
   (`{domain}-affinity-{system}-{table}`).
3. **`import-tmdl` concept-mapping**
   (`integration/sources/powerbi/*-concept-mapping.yaml`) —
   `reference_model_match` + `action` (use|specialize|new_class|skip);
   corroborates matching class claims; `new_class` actions become `proposed` gap
   candidates **only when a single domain is being processed**.
4. **SKOS mappings** (`model/mappings/*.ttl`) — `skos:*Match` bronze→domain links
   attached as `skos_mapping` evidence to matching class/property claims.
5. **Sample-derived signals** — enum-candidate / FK-shape signals attached as
   `sample_signal` evidence.

**C4 guard — all derived/new claims are `status: proposed`, never auto-`approved`.**
Probabilistic evidence (affinity/alignment/concept-mapping) must never masquerade
as approval. Human decisions are preserved across re-runs via the existing
`merge_preserving_decisions()` in `claim_registry.py`. Conflicting evidence is
**surfaced** (low-confidence proposed claims / rationale notes), never silently
resolved.

For parity with the AI commands `derive-claims` reuses the shared helpers:
`_concurrency.map_concurrent` (`--max-workers`, default 8; 1 = serial, parallel
per-domain) and the `_cache` sidecar (`--force` bypasses; cache file at
`<analysis-dir>/.cache/derive-claims.json`). It is a skill-managed command in the
soft skill-gate set, so it emits the skill-gate warning unless
`KAIROS_SKILL_CONTEXT=1`.

### Rationale

The hard interpretation already happened upstream, so this step is **pure
deterministic plumbing**: a reproducible join with no model variance and no token
spend. Keeping it AI-free makes re-runs free, fast, and diffable, and keeps the
strong (anchored alignment) vs weak (affinity-only) evidence distinguishable in
the registry. Reusing `merge_preserving_decisions()` guarantees human dispositions
survive re-aggregation, and reusing `_concurrency`/`_cache` gives operational
parity (flags, cache semantics, per-domain parallelism) with `analyse-sources` /
`propose-alignment` without inventing a new execution model.

**Cost banner deliberately omitted.** `derive-claims` does **not** call
`_cost.print_cost_warning` because nothing is billed — it issues no LLM calls.
Printing a cost banner for a free deterministic command would train users to
ignore the banner where it actually matters (the paid AI commands), so the
omission is intentional, not an oversight.

### Consequences

- One command turns already-produced customer assets (affinity, alignment,
  concept-mapping, SKOS, samples) into a richer candidate claim set, reducing
  hand-authoring before human curation/approval.
- No claim is ever auto-approved; the approval gate (`check-claims`) is unchanged.
- Evidence granularity is preserved: each claim can carry multiple
  `evidence_sources`, keeping strong vs weak evidence visible.
- A future opt-in **`--llm-reconcile`** flag (LLM tie-breaking / rationale
  synthesis, **with** a cost banner) is explicitly **deferred** to a later slice —
  noted as future work, not implemented here.

## DD-EL-6: Slice 4 — MDM/reference-data rules + ownership hardening live in `check-claims`

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Affects:** `model/claims/{domain}-claims.yaml` (new registry fields), `claim_registry.py`
(`ReferenceData` / `Deviation` / `OwnershipOverride` dataclasses, `validate_registry`,
`merge_preserving_decisions` / `HUMAN_CURATED_FIELDS`), `claim_coverage.py`
(`check_claims_coverage` + `ClaimCheckReport`), `data-domains.yaml` consumption,
`check-claims` CLI (`--no-mdm-anchor` / `--no-ownership`), evidence-led design skills
(`kairos-design-source`, `kairos-execute-project`)
**Implementation:** Slice 4 (MDM/reference-data rules + ownership hardening). Realizes the
MDM-first concept (C6). Spec:
`docs/implementation/evidence-led-modeling/slice-4-mdm-ownership.md`

### Context

After Slices 1–2 the Claim Registry governs *what is approved to materialize* and approved
claims deterministically drive projection, but the registry had no vocabulary for
reference/master data, cross-domain ownership exceptions, or client-native deviation
records, and `check-claims` enforced none of the MDM-first / ownership rules the
methodology requires (§5.4 MDM anchors, §11.2 passthrough promotion, §12/§14 deviation log,
§14 ownership boundaries). Broad domain claims could be approved before their reference-data
anchors (conformed dimensions, code lists, natural keys) were even known; a claim could
silently cross another data-domain's `data-domains.yaml` boundary; client-native (`gap`)
classes could land with no recorded owner/reason; and high-use passthrough fields had no
promotion-review signal.

### Decision

Add the reference-data / ownership vocabulary to the registry **as YAML-registry fields**
(not kairos-ext TTL annotations — these are governance metadata, so `kairos-ext.ttl` needs
no change), and enforce the rules **inside the single `check-claims` governance gate** rather
than as separate CLI commands or in structural `validate_registry`:

- **Schema additions (`claim_registry.py`):** new `ReferenceData`
  (`authority_system` / `code_system` / `key` / `scd_type`), `Deviation`
  (`reason` / `owner` / `gap_request`), and `OwnershipOverride` (`owner` / `rationale`)
  dataclasses, plus `Claim` fields `reference_data`, `mdm_anchor`, `deviation`,
  `ownership_override`, and `passthrough_reviewed`. All `to_dict`/`from_dict` omit
  None/default keys so the byte-stable golden output is preserved. `validate_registry`
  gains light **structural** checks only (warn if `reference_data`/`mdm_anchor` set on a
  non-`reference_data` claim; error if an `ownership_override` lacks owner or rationale).
  `merge_preserving_decisions` / `HUMAN_CURATED_FIELDS` preserve the new curated fields
  across re-runs.
- **Four governance checks (`claim_coverage.py`), reported via `ClaimCheckReport`:**
  - **MDM-anchor gate (§5.4):** a *broad domain claim* is an approved class claim with
    disposition claim/specialize. If a domain has broad claims **and** declared
    `mdm_anchor` reference-data claims still `proposed` → `anchor_pending` (**BLOCKING**).
    If broad claims but **no** declared anchors → `anchor_missing` (**WARNING**) — pragmatic
    per §5.4 ("anchors must be *known*, not fully implemented").
  - **deviation-log (§12/§14):** approved `gap` (client-native) claims lacking a deviation
    record (owner + reason) → `deviation_missing` (**BLOCKING**).
  - **ownership-boundary (§14):** approved claims whose `class_uri` starts with another
    data-domain's `uris` prefix (from `data-domains.yaml`) and not the registry's own
    domain → `ownership_conflicts` (**BLOCKING**) unless an `ownership_override`
    (owner + rationale) is present.
  - **passthrough-review (§11.2):** high-use passthrough claims (evidence spans ≥2 source
    systems, OR a powerbi measure/slicer/filter/hierarchy/join/fk/sample_signal evidence
    type, OR any evidence carries a `measure`) not yet `passthrough_reviewed` →
    `passthrough_review` (**WARNING**).
- **Shared-conformed-dimension escape hatch:** cross-file same-URI approved claims now route
  to `shared_dimensions` (**WARNING**) instead of `duplicate_approved` (**BLOCKING**) when
  either claim carries an `ownership_override` — the documented owner+rationale that lets a
  conformed dimension be shared across domains.
- **CLI:** `check-claims` gains `--no-mdm-anchor` and `--no-ownership` to skip those gates.

### Rationale

`check-claims` is the **one** deterministic governance gate, so the MDM/ownership rules
belong there ("ownership checks are the gate's responsibility", per the validator
docstring): a single gate means one place a reviewer/CI consults for *may this materialize?*,
no fragmented governance across multiple commands, and no risk of a separate command being
skipped. Keeping the new fields as YAML-registry metadata (not TTL annotations) reflects that
they are *governance* facts, not ontology semantics, so the reviewable ontology diff and
`kairos-ext.ttl` are untouched. Splitting MDM-anchor into a **blocking** `anchor_pending`
(anchors declared but undecided) vs a **warning** `anchor_missing` (no anchors declared)
keeps the gate pragmatic per §5.4 — it forces anchors to be *known* without demanding every
reference table be fully implemented before broad claims can proceed. The `ownership_override`
escape hatch makes conformed-dimension sharing an explicit, owned, reviewable decision rather
than either a hard block or a silent duplicate. Structural well-formedness stays in
`validate_registry`; the *policy* judgement (what crosses a boundary, what needs an anchor)
stays in the gate.

### Consequences

- Broad domain claims cannot be approved-and-shipped before their reference-data anchors are
  at least known; undocumented cross-domain or client-native claims block the gate until an
  owner/rationale or deviation record is supplied.
- Conformed dimensions are shareable across domains, but only via an explicit
  `ownership_override` (owner + rationale) that downgrades the cross-file duplicate to a
  `shared_dimensions` warning.
- High-use passthrough fields surface a `passthrough_review` warning until a human marks
  `passthrough_reviewed`, nudging promotion review without blocking.
- `--no-mdm-anchor` / `--no-ownership` give a deliberate, named bypass for hubs not yet doing
  MDM governance; golden registry output is unchanged because all new fields are omitted when
  default.
