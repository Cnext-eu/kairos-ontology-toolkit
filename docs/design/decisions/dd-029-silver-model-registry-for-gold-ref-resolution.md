# DD-029: Silver Model Registry for Gold ref() Resolution

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Affects:** `projections/medallion_dbt_projector.py`, gold dbt model generation
**Implementation:** `_build_silver_model_registry()`, updated `_silver_model_name_for_class()`

### Context

When `goldIncludeImports "true"` adds imported reference-model classes to the gold
projection, `_silver_model_name_for_class()` resolves imported class URIs to their own
local names (e.g., `purchase_order`). However, silver models are generated under hub
domain class names (e.g., `hub_order`), causing broken `{{ ref() }}` calls in gold dbt
models.

Additionally, gold models were selecting ALL ontology properties regardless of whether
silver actually generates those columns (post DD-026 unmapped-column exclusion).

### Decision

Build an in-memory **silver model registry** after silver generation:

1. **Name registry** (`dict[str, str]`): maps class URIs (including imported parent URIs)
   to actual silver model file names.
2. **Columns registry** (`dict[str, set[str]]`): maps silver model names to the set of
   column names they actually generate.

Parent URI mapping uses a **single-child rule**: a parent URI is only registered when
exactly one hub class extends it. Ambiguous parents (multiple children) trigger a warning
and are not registered.

Gold column filtering: gold models only SELECT columns that exist in the referenced
silver model's column set (structural columns like `_sk`, `_type`, `valid_from/to`,
`is_current` are exempt from filtering).

### Rationale

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Registry (chosen)** | O(1) lookup; built once; no graph traversal at call time | Small memory overhead |
| Walk rdfs:subClassOf at call time | No extra data structure | Complex; must handle cycles; slow |
| Manifest file between phases | Explicit contract | File I/O; ordering fragility |
| Cross-domain global registry | Handles cross-domain gold refs | Unnecessary — gold refs are per-domain |

### Consequences

- Gold `{{ ref() }}` calls now correctly resolve to the actual silver model name
- Gold models only SELECT columns that silver provides — no broken column references
- Backward-compatible: registry is additive; existing behavior unchanged when registry is empty
- Cross-domain gold refs remain unsupported (separate concern, not affected by this change)
